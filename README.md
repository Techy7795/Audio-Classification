# Audio-Classification
**Baby Cry Classification Using Deep Learning**
This project aims to classify audio recordings to determine whether a baby is crying or not. Using deep learning techniques, the model can effectively identify crying sounds amidst various background noises.

</div>
**Dataset**: Audio samples of baby cries ,noise, laugh, silence.<br/>
**Preprocessing**: Applied noise reduction and normalization to improve audio quality.<br/>
**Feature Extraction**: Utilized Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs), Zero Crossing Rate for capturing essential audio features,Takes average value.<br/>
**Model Architecture**: Implemented a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for effective pattern recognition in audio signals.<br/>
**Training**: Trained the model with augmented audio data to enhance robustness and generalization.<br/>
**Evaluation**: Achieved **92.5%** accuracy and F1-score, indicating reliable performance in distinguishing baby cries from other sounds.<br/>
